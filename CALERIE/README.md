# Abstract

In this study, we analyzed data from  Phase II of the CALERIE study which examined the effects of caloric restriction on many different health outcomes and biomarkers over two years.
We clustered participants based on their percentage calorie intake for 5 meal categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and other). 

We end up with 3 clusters. Participants in the first cluster eat 13% percent of the overall calorie for breakfast, 26% for lunch, 32% for dinner, 10.5% for snack, and 18% for other. 
Participants in the first cluster eat 14% percent of the overall calorie for breakfast, 31% for lunch, 42% for dinner, 12% for snack, and 0.009% for other.  
Participants in the first cluster eat 21% percent of the overall calorie for breakfast, 30% for lunch, 34% for dinner, 13% for snack, and 0.015% for other. 

# Note

This study is not completed and can be further improved. For example, we can try other clustering methods; we can also extend the analysis on the resulted clusters to check whether the participants within each cluster have other distinctive features.
